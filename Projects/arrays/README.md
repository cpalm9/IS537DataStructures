# Assignment: Arrays

Write a dynamic array class that has the following features:

1. Automatically allocate memory when items are added (in chunks).
2. Automatically deallocate memory when items are deleted (in chunks).
3. Track its own size using a class variable, independent of the actual memory allocated.
4. Initialize with 10 empty slots.
5. Increase or decrease the allocated memory slots by 5 at a time (i.e. chunk size is 5).
